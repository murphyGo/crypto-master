# Technical Debt Unit Map

## Purpose

This document maps active `docs/TECH-DEBT.md` items to AI-DLC units. It is a
planning index, not the debt source of truth. Update `docs/TECH-DEBT.md` first
when debt is added or resolved, then refresh this map.

## Active Debt by Unit

No active registered debt items in this integrated snapshot.

## Debt Details

DEBT-082 is resolved by native production verification. The concurrent
DEBT-074/078/084/085/086 implementation closures are preserved in
`docs/TECH-DEBT.md`; their later source changes are not deployed as part of
the source35e14b4 production image.

## Promotion Candidates

No additional promotion candidates.

## Update Rules

- If `docs/TECH-DEBT.md` moves an item to resolved, remove it here in the same
  change.
- If a new debt item references a legacy phase, map it through
  `legacy-phase-map.md` before assigning a unit.
- If a debt item spans multiple units, choose the unit that owns the first code
  change as primary and list the other as secondary.
