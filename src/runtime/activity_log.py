"""Append-only activity log for the trading engine (Phase 8.1).

Every meaningful step the engine takes — cycle started, proposal
generated, auto-decision, position opened/closed, monitor pass,
sleep, shutdown — is recorded as one JSON line. The dashboard reads
this file to surface what the engine is doing in real time.

The format mirrors :mod:`src.feedback.audit` (``AuditLog``): one JSON
object per line, independent open/append/close per write so concurrent
readers and writers don't corrupt earlier events. The append-only
shape means a crash leaves at most one partially-written final line —
which ``read_all`` skips with a warning.

Phase 10.4 routes the file through :class:`JsonlRotator` so writes
land in monthly files (``activity.YYYY-MM.jsonl``) and reads merge the
active month + the most-recent ``Settings.log_retention_months``
archives. The base path stored on ``self.path`` is now the rotator's
base (no extension), not a single concrete file.

Related Requirements:
- FR-009 / FR-010: Live + paper trading mode (production wiring)
- FR-026: Automated Feedback Loop (visibility into the loop)
- NFR-008: log retention (Phase 10.4).
